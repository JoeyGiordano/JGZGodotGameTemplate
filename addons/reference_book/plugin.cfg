description="Adds a Reference Book tab in the bottom panel that allows you to quickly add resource references to a specified script.

When using Godot, I have an autoload to store all my resource references so my code doesn't get clogged up with paths and load() calls.
It was annoying to write a line for every resource, so I made this addon.

How to use:
	First, you need to specify the file you want reference lines to be added to. (You only have to do this once).
	Make a script where you want to store all the references.
	Make sure there is at least one export group in the script (ie add the line @export_group(\"Test\") ).
	Navigate to Project>Tools>Reference Book...
	Type the scripts path in the text box, then press the plus button.
	(You can add as many scripts as you want. You can remove scripts using the x buttons. Feel free to remove the default path).
	Close the popup window.
	
	Now you can use the tool!
	Navigate to the bottom panel and select the Ref Book tab.
	Drag any resource into the box where it says <empty>. (Or press the file icon to start a load file dialog).
	Select the script you want to add the line to in the dropdown menu. (This doesn't revert between uses).
	On the right, adjust the settings. A preview of the line to be added is shown below. (Only the name setting reverts).
	When you're satisfied, press the Add to Reference Book button. The line is now added in your script under your chosen export group!

Warning: This plugin uses a deprecated method (as of Godot 4.5). It still works fine!

I hope this makes your reference making faster and easier! What will you do with all the extra time??? Maybe eat strawberry shortcake!
